Mods Removed out:
    Totemic (didn't quit find a way for it to mesh with the others and not feature overlap) 
    Tinker's Construct (over shadowed other mods tools, which I didn't want happening)(though I wish I could keep just the smeltery)
    Storage Drawers (makes inventory trivial in certain respects, though I may put it back in but nerf)
    Dynamic Trees (removed due to unsurity of pack scope and potential performace issues)(also might not go well with TF)
