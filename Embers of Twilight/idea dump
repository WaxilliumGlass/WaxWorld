Current ideas:
  Integrate Roots 2 with Botania, herbs required in recipies. Also embers crystals, used in rune. Make the herbs part of flower crafting.
  
  Separate flue from slime in the ore dict, want it used for specific things. Well, I could just specify glue on
  the recipes I want instead of oredict. 
  
  Flight from Botanai is limited to until after finishing Twilight Forest. Probably achievement locked. 
  Also may turn off the Relic for extending flight. 
  
  Glimmer augment and lamp locked until light queen (whatever that bug is, TF) is aquired.
  
  Charcoal made using woodpiles from Forestry, used as a none consumed fire block for the cauldron (BWM) (I think coal gets consumed)
  
  Alloy is either made using grit or in the Alloy Kiln. 
  Grit is made with the grinder only. 
  
  Comforts mod? Could have this used as a none spawn setting beds for the first part and have the bed require more work. 
  
Dismissed ideas for this pack:
  Iron gravel, but inst4ead of smelting it when it's broken it drops iron nuggets and gravel. 
  Iron gravel will be around due to ore deposits being rare. Just enough to get people started. Well... maybe
  
  Ore is rare and is prospected using flowers/bone meal?? (if the mod updates)
  
  Ratios is 1x, 1.5x, 2x for normal ore
  -furnace, smelter, crusher-
  Poor ore? Might have to make by hand
  =2 nuggets? 
  -will be prevalent
  
  Could I use Modular Machinery to make a tool crafting station for metal tools instead of Tinker's? Retexture blocks probably, 
  more in line with IE (not happening in EoT)
  
  Tinker's COnstruct
  {
    Silk touch jewell locked until a tool is attained or enchanted with it. Is it possible? Same with fortune. 
    Can I limit the levels of them on tools so the normal mods can still has a place?
    
    Will need an itme reuiqred to get speed augment. 
    
    Smelting Jewell either locked behind Embers or TF or both
    
    mining hammers locked until a hammer weapon is attained, potentially one of Mozie's mobs. 
    
    Turn off Quark hoe grass harvesting, sythe is for that. 
    
    Clever will need an item unlock as well. 
    
    Have the blue and green slime crystals used in things? The slime flower from Botania? 
    
    Turn off most alloying in TC smeltery other than manalian and pig iron.
